# Bike_Share_Data_Project
## Project Mission
Cyclistic - a bike sharing company wants to understand the differences in usage and riding pattern of the two types of users of their bikes: Casual Riders and Annual Members. The company targets to increase its profit by maximizing the number of annual memberships, which has been concluded to be more profitable than casual rides. This project aims to process and analyze 12 months of user data to find out the main differences between the two types of riders, enabling the company to come up with a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## What sets us apart:
1. 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.
2. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station.
3. Flexibility of its pricing plans: Single-ride passes,Full-day passes,Annual Memberships.
4. Reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike.

5. ## Business Task:
The company wants develop an effective marketing strategy for the casual riders to convert them to annual members, in order to increase their profit.

The main task of this project is finding an answer to the question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
